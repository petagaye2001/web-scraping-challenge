Web Scraping Challenge
In this assignment, I will build a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page. The following outlines the steps I took


I created a new repository for this project called `web-scraping-challenge`. * and cloned the new repository to my computer.

Inside my local git repository, i created a directory for the web scraping challenge. Using a folder name to correspond to the challenge: **Missions_to_Mars**.

I added my notebook files to this folder as well as your flask app and push the above changes to GitHub or GitLab.

Step  1
    established all my dependencies
    also included a webdriver manager.chrome  imported from chromeDriver Manager
    installed chromedrives
    
Scraped the latest news title and paragrpah text from website and printed in Jupyter notebook
